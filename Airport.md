# Airport Delays/Cancellations Analysis

There are various factors that result in delays and cancellations to any airport and airline whether they are weather cancellations tp security problems. In this analysis these factors will be segmented to find specifics in order to identify negative patterns that resulted in significant issues in the flight processs. This allows for removal of processes and issues that cause problems which can increase efficiency and reduce the amount of disruptions to create a more reliable airline industry.

The main questions that are being asked to help the process:
- What is the primary reason for each flight cancellation?
- What airlines have the highest and lowest cancellations?
- How do airlines arrival and departure delays compare?

## Cancellations
### Cancellation Reasons
In the dashboard the cancellations for each airline were able to tracked in the data and the reason for each was segmented as well. This gave the amount for each which shows which airlines have the most and splits it into specific reasons for the airline.

## Cancellation Rate
In the previous chart the amount of cancellations for each airline was visible as well as the reason, but that was moreso for finding the reason a specific airline cancels the most. However, the cancellation rate lets it be seen which airlines have the highest/lowest rates of cancellation signalling which has the largest problems.

## Delays
Besides cancellations another factor that negatively impacts airlines significantly is delays on their flights. Relating to delays there are two types of delays on the arrival of planes and delays on the departure. This visualization showcases the average time it takes for each airline to arrive and depart while also comparing them.
